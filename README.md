# House

Python Essentials Project Portfolio - Code Institute

View deployed site [here.](https://l3wk3m.github.io/house/)

 *House* is a command-line interface program whose main goal is to deliver the experience of a psychological horro themed text-based adventure game. The user if taken straight to the Main Menu where they get to choose to begin the game or not. Upon receiving the user's input, the application will launch into it's main game loop. Subsequently, the user is provided with their current game-state and prompted with two options of which path they would like to take next. The user will ultimately arrive at 1 of 4 different endings.

## Deployment

This site is deployed using Heroku. To deploy it from its GitHub repository to Heroku, I took the following steps:
1. Log in (or sign up) to Heroku.
2. Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard and select 'Create New App'.
3. I then named my deployment house_l3wk3m.
4. Select your region. I'm in Europe so I chose Europe.
5. Click 'Create App'.
6. On the next page, click on the 'Settings' tab.
7. Head to the 'Config Vars' section. In the box for 'KEY' enter PORT and in the box for 'VALUE' enter 8000.
8. Scroll down to the 'Add Buildpack' sectoin and click 'Add Buildpack'. Click on the 'PYTHON' buildpack and click 'Save Changes', then click 'Add Buildpack' again and select 'NODEJS'. Make sure you select these two in this order.
9. Now head down to the deployment section and, under the 'Deployment Method' heading, click 'Connect to Github'.
10. Once connected, click in the search box and search for the 'house' repo (you will need to have cloned the 'House' repo from my github if you are deploying this yourself - in order to do this, please see the 'Cloning This Repository' guide below)
11. Choose either 'Automatic Deploys' or 'Manual Deploys' in order to deploy your project. I chose Automatic for the purposes of testing, but if you're just deploying the app to use it yourself, you can select 'Manual Deploy'.
12. You will see the app being built in the 'Build Master' terminal below the deploy options once you've deployed.
13. When you've seen its done, you will see an 'App successfully deployed' message, with a link to click through to view your project.
